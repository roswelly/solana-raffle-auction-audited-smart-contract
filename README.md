## Smart Contract Architecture

### Raffle Contract

- Users enter the raffle by purchasing tickets (SPL tokens / NFTs).

- Winner is selected using Solana's VRF (Verifiable Random Function) or Oracle.

- Funds are distributed automatically to the winner and the organizer.

### Auction Contract

- Supports English Auctions (highest bidder wins) and Dutch Auctions (price decreases over time).

- Bidders deposit SPL tokens or NFTs.

- The highest bidder at the end wins the asset.

- Funds are automatically transferred to the seller after auction completion.
